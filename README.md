# Sample Flourish template: circle

This sample template demonstrates how settings can be used to change the state
of a graphic, and how to use D3 transitions to animate a graphic to an updated state.

Use the [Flourish SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flourish/sdk) to try it out.

The main code file for the template is [`src/index.js`](https://github.com/kiln/example-template-circle/blob/master/src/index.js).
